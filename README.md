# RibDif

RibDif evaluates the usefulness of a given amplicon at differentiating within a genus or species

You can run RibDif through BioLib or get the tool yourself at our [github](https://github.com/Rob-murphys/ribdif)

Please report any issue [here](https://github.com/Rob-murphys/ribdif/issues) on our github.

## Primer file format
```
v3v4	CCTACGGGNGGCNGCAG	GACTACNNGGGTATCTAATCC	550
v1v9	AGRGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG 	RGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT	1800
```

Where the columns are: primer name | forward sequence | reverse sequence | expected amplicon size

## Enabling NCBI ftp servers

Before using RibDif you must add `ftp.ncbi.nih.gov` and `ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` to your list of __Allowed third-party__ hosts in your accounts [Compute Options](https://biolib.com/settings/compute/)

## Output

RibDif generate a new directory within the specified output directory (<current working directory>/results by default) names after the genus in question.

The most important files will be within the `<genus name>` and then the `figures/` subdirectory.

If running as default on whole 16S genes extracted by barrnap you will see:
`<genus>_16S_summary.tsv` which contains a summery of each genomes and how many whole 16S genes were present
`<genus>_<primer name>-amp_summary.tsv` which contains a summery of each genomes and how many amplicons it produced

__OR__ if run with `--whole-genome` mode you will only see:
`<genus>_<primer name>-amp_summary.tsv` which contains a summery of each genomes and how many amplicons it produced

No matter your settings you will have `<genus>_<primer name>_overlap_report.txt` which show the text based summary of your run that is also printed to console

Within `figures/` are the heatmaps and network graphs for a more visual representation of the results.

`full/` contains the concatinated full 16S sequences if not using `--whole-genome`.
