# RibDif2

RibDif was initially designed to evaluate the usefulness of a given amplicon at differentiating within a genus or species.
It can also be used to aid in primer design for any primer set be it aimed at amplifying function genes or used to species differentiation.
The tool will give you am amplification rate across the diversity of the selected genus so one can see how successful their primers are.

You can run RibDif through BioLib or get the tool yourself at our [github](https://github.com/Rob-murphys/ribdif)

Please report any issue [here](https://github.com/Rob-murphys/ribdif/issues) on our github.

Several features are left out of the BioLib version due to limitations with the platform therfore we suggest is possible,
you use the command line version of the tool. If you are a windows use you can access the command line by running  the 
[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) native to all windows 10 installs and later.
From there you can follow our GitHub install instructions

## Primer file format
```
v3v4	CCTACGGGNGGCNGCAG	GACTACNNGGGTATCTAATCC	550
v1v9	AGRGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG 	RGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT	1800
```

Where the columns are: primer name | forward sequence | reverse sequence | expected amplicon size

## Enabling NCBI ftp servers

Before using RibDif you must add `ftp.ncbi.nih.gov` and `ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` to your list of __Allowed third-party__ hosts in your accounts [Compute Options](https://biolib.com/settings/compute/)

## Output

RibDif2 generates a new directory within the specified output directory ("<current working directory>/results" by default) nameed after the genus in question.

The most important files will be within the `<genus>` and then the `figures/` subdirectory.

If running as default on whole 16S genes extracted by barrnap you will see:
`<genus>_16S_summary.tsv` which contains a summary of all genomes and how many whole 16S genes were present
`<genus>_<primer name>-amp_summary.tsv` which contains a summery of each genomes and how many amplicons it produced

__OR__ if run with `--whole-genome` mode you will only see:
`<genus>_<primer name>-amp_summary.tsv` which contains a summary of all genomes and how many amplicons it produced

No matter your settings you will have `<genus>_<primer name>_overlap_report.txt` which show the text-based 
summary of your run that is also printed to console

Within `figures/` are the heatmaps and network graphs for a more visual representation of the results.

`full/` contains the concatinated full 16S sequences if not using `--whole-genome`.

The individually downloaded genomes are found in `refseq/<domain>`

### Figures

We suggest visiting [our github](https://github.com/Rob-murphys/ribdif) to get an explination of the output with accompanying figures.
However below is a only text based description

The provided figures include all those from version one plus the new additional network that illustrates shared alleles. 
For example a run using Pseudoalteromonas would produce the following (as of 07/07/2023)

See figure one [here](https://github.com/Rob-murphys/ribdif/blob/main/docs/Pseudoalteromonas-v3v4_heatmap.png))

We can see 58 unique alleles have been identified many of which are identicle in multiple genomes such as allele 2 which 
is shared across genome beloning to issachenkonii / espejiana / tetraodonis / carrageenovora / atlantica / sp. / agarivorans and allele 11 which is shared
across flavipulchra / sp. / rubra / piscicida / viridis. Hence these species cannot be separated using V3-V4 amplicon sequencing. Below
we can see these two indistinguishable clusters being represented in networks. Node represent a genome and edges represent shared alleles, 
with thickness representing the number of shared alleles.

See figure 2 [here](https://github.com/Rob-murphys/ribdif/blob/main/docs/Pseudoalteromonas-v3v4_graphs.png))

The text-based output for the above V3-V4 would be as below. Showing 100% amplification rate of the primers.

```
Summary of Pseudoalteromonas differentiation by v3v4 amplicons:

                    Genomes downloaded: 71
                        With species name: 40

                        Without species name: 31

                    39 of 71 (54.93%) genomes that amplified have multiple alleles.
                    20 of 27 (74.07%) species that experienced amplification have at least one overlap.
